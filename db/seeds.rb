# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# book1 = Book.new(isbn: "4047306525",title: "Kancolle",author: "tsukiji",publisher: "famitsu")
# book1.save
# user1 = User.find_by(nickname: "hoge")
#
# relation = BooksUser.new(book_id: book1.id, user_id: user1.id)
# relation.save
